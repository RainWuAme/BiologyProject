SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

Plays a role as a negative regulator of the GCN2 kinase activity; impairs GCN1-mediated GCN2 activation, and hence GCN2-mediated eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation in amino acid-starved cells and subsequent down-regulation of protein synthesis (PubMed:15126500, PubMed:15937339, PubMed:24333428). In normal conditions, it resides in a actin complex and has no activity (PubMed:15126500). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15126500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15937339, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24333428}."

May act by recruiting MYO1 and HOF1, a protein involved in septation, to the site of cleavage.
